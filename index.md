## About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Ph.D. student at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I have experience in remote sensing image processing, including image fusion and classification. I am currently working on analyzing the impacts of climate changes on crop yields and Knowledge-guided machine learning for vegetation parameter retrieval.

- **2021-present:** Ph.D. Student, University of Minnesota
- **2018-2021:** M.Sc., Beijing Normal University
- **2014-2018:** B.E., China University of Geosciences

## Research Interests

- **Knowledge-guided machine learning:** transfer learning, data assimilation
- **Climate change adaptation:** climate warming, crop yield
- **Satellite image processing:** data fusion, land cover/use mapping
- **Geomorphology:** river, dam, sediment
