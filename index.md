## About Me

-: I am a Ph.D. student at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I have experience in remote sensing image processing, including image fusion and classification. I am currently working on analyzing the impacts of climate changes on crop yields and Knowledge-guided machine learning for vegetation parameter retrieval.

## Education

- **2021-present:** Ph.D. Student, University of Minnesota
- **2018-2021:** M.Sc., Beijing Normal University
- **2014-2018:** B.E., China University of Geosciences

## Research Interests

- **Knowledge-guided machine learning:** transfer learning, data assimilation
- **Climate change adaptation:** climate warming, crop yield
- **Satellite image processing:** data fusion, land cover/use mapping
- **Geomorphology:** river, dam, sediment

## News

- **[Feb. 2024]** Our paper about climate warming impacts on cattle meat yields is published in Communications Earth & Environment.
- **[Dec. 2023]** Our paper about KGML-DA is published in Remote Sensing of Environment.
- **[Dec. 2023]** Our paper about transfer learning is published in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.
