## About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Ph.D. student at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I have experience in remote sensing image processing, including image fusion and classification. I am currently working on analyzing the impacts of climate changes on crop yields and Knowledge-guided machine learning for vegetation parameter retrieval.
