abstract: >-
  We found that dunes developed and flow resistance increased (+10%) in the post-Three Gorges Dam period. We ascertain that the development of dunes plays the dominant role in augmenting flow resistance, as evidenced by roughness height change (+29%) using a modified Van Rijn method. Ultimately, dune development was incorporated into a hydrogeomorphic numerical model of the Yangtze River to improve flow resistance quantification, and thus, the water level simulation.
