abstract: >-
  Denser vegetation has slowed flow velocity by 17% ± 2% and increased flow resistance by 21% ± 5%, offsetting the water-level decrease from channel expansion due to scouring and even causing a slight rise in floodwater levels. Furthermore, damming has markedly altered river connectivity, thermal regimes, and solute dynamics, detrimentally affecting fish habitats and aquatic life.
