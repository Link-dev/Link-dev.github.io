  This study utilized cloud-free, very-high-resolution DigitalGlobe imagery collected between 2018 and 2022 to identify each individual olive tree in six northern Morocco provinces. This research represents the first-of-its-kind individual olive tree mapping at the sub-national scale that can help monitor the large-scale land conversions such as about 110,000 ha of olive plantings in the six Moroccan provinces studies here. Meanwhile it demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient prototype approach that can be adapted to identify similar tree crop expansion occurring in other parts of the world.
