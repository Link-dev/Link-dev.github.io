abstract: >-
  The findings show that cattle meat yield increases as temperatures rise from low to medium and then decreases when annual average temperatures exceed 7 °C; this repose is pronounced in the grassland-based livestock system. Further, we show that warming creates unequal impacts between high- and low-income countries due to the divergent baseline temperature conditions. Future warming aggravates these unequal burdens between countries, with the most pronounced effects observed under the upper-middle emissions scenario.
