abstract: >-
  We examine the impacts of both GS and NGS climate conditions on the yield effect of the preceding crop in corn-soybean rotation systems from 1999 to 2018 in the US Midwest. By 2051–2070, we project that warming climates will reduce corn rotation benefits by 6.74% under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1-2.6 and 17.18% under SSP 5-8.5. For soybeans, warming climates are expected to increase rotation benefits by 8.36% under SSP 1-2.6 and 13.83% under SSP 5-8.5.
