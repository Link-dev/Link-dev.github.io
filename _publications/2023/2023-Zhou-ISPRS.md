  This study proposed a new framework based on deep transfer learning, which includes three key features that contribute to its high performance. The findings of this study highlight the value of transfer learning in estimation of vegetation biophysical parameters, which involves pre-training using sufficient existing satellite products to produce a generalized model and transferring knowledge from in-situ measurements to bridge gaps between satellite and field.
