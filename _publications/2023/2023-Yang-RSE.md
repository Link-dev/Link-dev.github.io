abstract: >-
  Hierarchical GRU-based network mimics process causality of an agroecosystem model. The KGML-DA flexibly assimilates historical and in-season multi-source data. Correcting the upstream variables constrains downstream variables in KGML-DA. Joint use of historical and in-season data performs best for yield prediction.
