abstract: >-
  An overall decline in low-flow water-levels (at a given small discharge) due to severe incisions of low-flow channels caused by a sharp reduction of ∼90% in sediment loads from 1950–2002 to 2003–2020. In contrast, high-flow water-levels (at a given large discharge) display minor changes. Our findings further the understanding of downstream geomorphic response to dam operation and their impacts on water levels and have important implications for riverine flood management in dammed river systems.
