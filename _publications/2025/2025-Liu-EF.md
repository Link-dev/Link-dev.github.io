abstract: >-
  Heat is mainly linked to the changes in soybean yield stability in the US Midwest. The negative yield stability responses to heat and drought can be mitigated by the irrigation but the negative response to excess wet would be amplified. Our results highlight the importance of climate extremes on stabilizing crop yield.
