  NeRF learns implicit neural representations of 3D crop fields from multi-angle images. The NeRF-LAI applies the gap fraction-based effective LAI estimation to a continuous field scale. The NeRF-LAI produces hemispherical gap fractions at an arbitrary viewpoint. The NeRF-LAI outperforms VI-based regression models in cross-site testing.
